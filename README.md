## 3D Multi-Robot Patrolling with a Two-Level Coordination Strategy

**Maintainer: Luigi Freda** 

This repository *3dpatrolling* will provide a C++ implementation behind our paper titled *3D Multi-Robot Patrolling with a Two-Level Coordination Strategy*. It will contains different ROS packages which allow to test the proposed multi-robot strategy within a V-REP simulation environment. The code will be made publicly available upon the publication of the related paper.

The multi-robot laser SLAM implementation is available under https://github.com/ethz-asl/laser_slam. The segment based localization algorithm can be found at https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmatch. 

More to come!
