## 3D Multi-Robot Patrolling with a Two-Level Coordination Strategy

**Authors: Luigi Freda, Mario Gianni, Fiora Pirri, Abel Gawel, Renaud Dubé, Roland Siegwart, Cesar Cadena** 

**Maintainer: Luigi Freda** 

Our paper has been accepted for publication in [Autonomous Robots](http://www.springer.com/10514). We are currently working to extract the code from our [TRADR](https://github.com/tradr-project) repository and make it a usable in a self-contained simulation framework. This will be available very soon within a few weeks.

This repository *3dpatrolling* will provide a C++ implementation behind our paper titled *3D Multi-Robot Patrolling with a Two-Level Coordination Strategy*. It will contains different ROS packages which allow to test the proposed multi-robot strategy within a V-REP simulation environment.

The multi-robot laser SLAM implementation is available under https://github.com/ethz-asl/laser_slam.   

More to come!
